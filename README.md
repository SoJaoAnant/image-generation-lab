This is an Implementation and exploration of generative image modeling architectures including VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models.

Several different types of datasets are used such as MNIST, Cat and Dog, Flowers and Anime Faces

you can find the experimentation logs, results and examples in the following

## AutoEncoders

One of the earliest architectures of image generation models whose task was  
to reconstruct the input image as accuractly as possible from the image's  
latent representation.

## GANs (Generative Adversal Networks)

<img src="Images and Examples\gans.png" width="400">

One of the most interesting concepts of neural architectures was GANs.
It consists of two models which are put against each other in a competition where both the models are supposed to do their tasks and try not to get their losses increased.

The Generator tries to generate fake samples of the input image domain and its task is to fool the discriminator into believeing that the images generated by it are real.

The Discriminator tries to classify between the generated samples and the real samples whether fake or not, failing to do so will put it at loss, but its strength matters a lot so it is either not always fooled by the Generator or it starts to bully the generator and does not let it learn anything.

## Diffusion models

The Modern King of image generation, inspired by the brownian motion.
Diffusion models work on the concept of training a model to denoise a static image to the point that it becomes an image.
Learning and Work about Diffusion models is still in progress...
